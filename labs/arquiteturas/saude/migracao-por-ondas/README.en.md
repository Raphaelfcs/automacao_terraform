# Wave-based migration to EKS

[Português](README.md) · **English**

> AWS platform of a health insurer (2024)

Integrators migrated in waves, each with its namespace, a queue with DLQ, a database per service and external access through Lambda.

### Wave-based migration to EKS

![Wave-based migration to EKS](desenho-2.png)

## Components found in the diagram

- Amazon EKS → module [`aws/eks-cluster`](../../../../aws/eks-cluster)
- Amazon RDS → module [`aws/rds-instance`](../../../../aws/rds-instance)
- Amazon S3 → module [`aws/s3-bucket`](../../../../aws/s3-bucket)
- Amazon SQS → module [`aws/sqs-queue`](../../../../aws/sqs-queue)
- AWS Lambda → module [`aws/lambda-function`](../../../../aws/lambda-function)
- API Gateway → module [`aws/api-gateway-lambda`](../../../../aws/api-gateway-lambda)
- Amazon CloudFront → module [`aws/cloudfront-spa`](../../../../aws/cloudfront-spa)
- Amazon VPC → module [`aws/vpc`](../../../../aws/vpc)
- AWS Secrets Manager: the RDS master password is already managed by RDS in Secrets Manager; application secrets come in through External Secrets

## Ready-made automation

The [`terraform/`](terraform) folder composes these catalog modules, in dependency order:

1. [`aws/kms-key`](../../../../aws/kms-key): Chave KMS (CMK) da plataforma
1. [`aws/vpc`](../../../../aws/vpc): VPC em três camadas
1. [`aws/eks-cluster`](../../../../aws/eks-cluster): Cluster EKS privado
1. [`aws/rds-instance`](../../../../aws/rds-instance): RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL privado
1. [`aws/sqs-queue`](../../../../aws/sqs-queue): Filas SQS com DLQ
1. [`aws/ecr`](../../../../aws/ecr): Repositórios ECR com scan, KMS e retenção

One module's outputs feed the next (for example `module.vpc.private_subnet_ids` and `module.kms_key.key_arn`), so there are no hard-coded IDs between layers.

### How to run

```bash
cd labs/arquiteturas/saude/migracao-por-ondas/terraform
# adjust locals.tf (prefix, region, tags) and backend.tf (state bucket/account)
terraform init
terraform plan -out tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

Sample values (accounts, IDs, domains) are fictitious; replace them with your own before applying.

## FinOps for this architecture

What weighs most on the bill for this solution and the lever for each item:

| Component | Cost driver | Lever |
|---|---|---|
| [`aws/eks-cluster`](../../../../aws/eks-cluster) | EKS nodes (EC2) and the per-cluster control plane | node autoscaling (Karpenter/Cluster Autoscaler), Spot for tolerant workloads and Savings Plans for the baseline |
| [`aws/rds-instance`](../../../../aws/rds-instance) | RDS instance class and Multi-AZ | right-size from real metrics, reserve PRD and stop HML/DEV after hours |
| [`aws/vpc`](../../../../aws/vpc) | NAT Gateway per AZ and the traffic it processes | a single NAT in DEV and VPC endpoints for S3/ECR to keep traffic off the NAT |
| [`aws/ecr`](../../../../aws/ecr) | old images piling up in ECR | lifecycle policy keeping only the last N images per repository |
| [`aws/kms-key`](../../../../aws/kms-key) | KMS keys per month and API calls | S3 bucket keys reduce KMS calls |
| [`aws/sqs-queue`](../../../../aws/sqs-queue) | queue requests | long polling and batch sends |

The FinOps cycle (inform, optimize, operate) is in the [FinOps process](../../telecom/processo-finops) lab.
To close the loop for this solution, also apply: [`aws/tag-compliance`](../../../../aws/tag-compliance), [`aws/finops-cost-report`](../../../../aws/finops-cost-report), [`aws/cur-focus-export`](../../../../aws/cur-focus-export), [`aws/instance-scheduler`](../../../../aws/instance-scheduler).
